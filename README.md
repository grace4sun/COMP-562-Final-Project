### Authors: Aknazar Janibek, Bryan Reed, Grace Sun, Amanda Xiao

This repository contains the following materials for our machine learning final project:
- Jupyter notebook with all of our code used to generate the models and figures presented in our research paper.
- PDF document of our final paper, written in LaTeX.
- Four figures references in our paper (graphs of stock prediction for NVIDIA and Boeing using LSTM and SVR models).

The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, is publically available for download at this link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/sp-500-stocks?select=sp500_companies.csv.

Abstract:

This study evaluates the effectiveness of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and Support Vector Regression (SVR) models in predicting the stock prices of NVIDIA and Boeing, using historical S\&P 500 data from 2010 to 2024. We aim to analyze and predict the diverging trends of these companies, focusing on how well each model captures their price movements. Our findings indicate that LSTM generally outperforms SVR, particularly in capturing the upward trend in NVIDIA’s stock prices, suggesting that LSTM models may be more adept at handling stocks with volatile patterns.
